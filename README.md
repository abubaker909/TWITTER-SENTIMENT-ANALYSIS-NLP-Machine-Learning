### Summary
1. **Environment Setup:**
   - Installed the `kaggle` library.
   - Downloaded and unzipped the Twitter sentiment dataset.
   - Imported necessary libraries and dependencies.

2. **Data Preparation:**
   - Loaded and processed the dataset.
   - Applied stemming and removed stopwords.
   - Split the data into training and test sets.

3. **Text Vectorization:**
   - Used `TfidfVectorizer` to convert text data into numerical features.

4. **Model Training:**
   - Implemented a logistic regression model.
   - Trained the model using a loop to store loss and accuracy metrics.

### Recommendations
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Make sure to remove unnecessary columns if they are not used for modeling (e.g., `ids`, `date`, `flag`, `user`).

2. **Validation:**
   - Consider using a validation set for tuning hyperparameters or evaluating model performance before testing on the test set.

3. **Optimization:**
   - Adjust the `max_iter` parameter if you encounter convergence warnings.
   - Implement early stopping to avoid overfitting or unnecessary training epochs.

4. **Metrics and Evaluation:**
   - Ensure you plot the loss and accuracy curves to visualize model performance over epochs.

5. **Testing:**
   - After training, evaluate your model on the test set to get a final accuracy score.
